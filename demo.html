<!-- And instead of throwing this away like everything else I feel like typing english for a minute or something close to it. So the footer of a page once labeled del-me.html and still likely delete bound, is the place where for I will rant and then shove it somewhere never to be seen, abe lincoln style. Yup you lke that Chuckie? This has no copyright obviously, do what you will if you find it. I dont care unless eric schmidt gives you a few million for it that is rightfully due my team, then we got problems. As is tradition, that would make said person in such a circumstance a lying moron a thieving puppet whose only self originating words are dishonest, whose deeds are as a lackey. Fuck you you are the polar opposite of me and you will never escape that...
moving on, cough, sample page by ray anthony all rights disregarded, and dismissed away as i have been. fuck you all (assuming I know you but sometimes even if I don't). <br>Rappleshots is made in 30 minute intervals inbetween spitting out pieces of my teeth kneeling on the floor priot to being evicted after making half a million dollars, having to destroy it by that assholes i did it for which i only did in order to temporarily survive for a month after I damn near almost became a rancher in argentina yup i considered it to get the money home and i hate horse manure, fucking stinks while my business partner has gone bonkers and not returning my calls and sending snarky one way emails while the biz acccount is red and i lost all my money getting back from argentina debacle which i might add , could have fucking died there. anyway this is typed in a bash terminal i cant even see really as its got no word wrapping borrowed styles compiled into references and its all by hand. you like that san francisco? its like a fucking utopian hand job, yeah!-->
