# RappleShots
==============

#### RappleShots are Ray's Apple IOS-ish Screenshots in Linux with Image Magick

My personal system of making *screenshots that don't suck* is designed for use with nautilus to give context menu click method of highlight and swift creation as in (1 click) processing, on multiple image files of various extensions into cool Apple IOS Style Screen shots. 

Turn on drop shadow and effects the, checkboxes basically for your gnome-screenshots utlity then reprocess with this tool. Same as in my other forthcoming repo of ImageMagick automation. I f'n love imagemagick, prcessing on the command line or 1 click shell "apps"? Seriously cool. I can handle 200 files before gimp even opens, and as usual do it on a chromebook with 12.04 ray-buntu (like chrubuntu)

If you use Nautilus/Unity/Gnome then drop this in $HOME/.gnome2/nautilus scripts/... without the extension and 
permission it root but executable. Good to go

Have Fun!
